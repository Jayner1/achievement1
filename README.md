Task 1.2

-Created recipe_1:
I decided to use the dictionary data structure. To me it makes because it uses key-value pairs. You can assign a key to a value, for example: Name: Tea, or math: 7. You can assign a score, or anything really. So assigning the recipe a name, ingredients, and cooking time just makes sense. 

-Created 4 more recipes

-Added all 5 recipes to an outer structure. That structure being a List:
  I decided to use a list for the outer structure because eleements inside can be modified or deleted very simply. I can edit a recipe as well as add a new recipe. Or even delete one. You can arrange the recipes alphabetically. It just made the most sense to me to use a list.
